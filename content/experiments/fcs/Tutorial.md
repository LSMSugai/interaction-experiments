We would like you to explore some long-duration environmental recordings, or **soundscapes**. You can see one in the space below.

Each soundscape contains 24 continuous hours (**a full day**) of audio, which have been collected from rural or wilderness sites. 

Please click _Next_---located above the soundscape.

---

Click the _Play_ <img src="play_button.png" class="ie-inline-image" /> button on the audio bar.

Try **clicking on the seek bar** at any point in the soundscape to learn more about it.

When you are happy that you understand how to use the audio, click _Next_.


---

If you drag your cursor over the soundscape (**left click and hold**) you will see a box appear. 

Next to the box is a field that you can use to enter a description of what you think the sound is. 

To keep a box visible you need to **save your label**. Try it now. 

Before you progress to the next screen, **delete all the boxes** you created by 
hovering over the box and clicking the delete button <img src="/annotorious/css/delete.png" class="ie-inline-image" />.

---

Take some time to explore some interesting points in the soundscape.

Box **five things** that you would **like to explore** more. Try to be as accurate drawing the box as you can be.

Please **label** them, noting  what you think they are or what you would like to know more.

When have **saved them**, hit _Continue_ below the soundscape.
