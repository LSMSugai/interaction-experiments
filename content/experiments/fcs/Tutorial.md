We would like you to explore some long-duration environmental recordings. There is one presented in the space below.

Each recording contains 24 continuous hours of audio (**a full day** running from midnight to midnight), which have been collected from rural or wilderness sites. 

Please click _Next_---located above the recording.

Click the _Play_ <img src="play_button.png" class="ie-inline-image" /> button on the audio bar. Can you hear sound playing? If not, please ensure that you can.

Try **clicking on the audio bar** at any point to listen to different parts of the recording.

When you are happy that you understand how to listen to different parts of the recording, click _Next_.

Drag your mouse pointer (**left click and hold**) in the field above the audio bar, where you think that a sound is located. 

A box will appear and under it, you can type a **label** of what you think the sound is. 

Click **save** to keep your box or click **cancel** to discard it. Experiment with creating some boxes and labels, then click _Next_. 



---

To **delete any boxes** you saved, hover over the box and click the delete button <img src="/fontAwesome/trash-alt-solid.svg" class="ie-inline-image" /> located in the labelling field. 

This will also show you the edit button <img src = "/annotorious/css/pencil.png" class="ie-inline-image"/>, which you can use to edit the labels. 

When you are happy that you understand how to box and label audio, click _Continue_ below the recording.
