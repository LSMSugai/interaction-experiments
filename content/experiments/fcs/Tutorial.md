Take some time to explore the soundscape further. We are about to give you two tasks.

This time we will be **timing you** to see how quickly you can find these sounds.

We would like you to find **one example** of each of the sounds listed as **quickly** as possible.

Your time **starts when you open the page** and **ends when you hit the 'Continue' button**.

Click Continue (under the visualisation) when you are ready to begin.
