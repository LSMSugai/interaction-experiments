We would like you to explore some long-duration environmental recordings, or soundscapes.

They will appear in the space below.

Each soundscape contains 24 continuous hours (a full day) of audio, which may have been collected from suburban, rural or wilderness sites. 

Please click _Next_ - located above the soundscape.

# 
Find a point in the soundscape that you think might be interesting to listen to. 

Click the play button on the audio bar.

Try dragging the audio button to that point in the soundscape to learn more about it.

When you are happy that you understand how to use it, click _Next_.

# 
If you drag your cursor over the soundscape (left click and hold) you will see a box appear. 

Next to the box is a field that you can use to enter a description of what you think the sound is. 

Try drawing a box anywhere on the soundscape and entering a description of what you think it is.
You can use the audio bar to give you more information.

See if you can find, box, and label the dawn chorus. 
The dawn chorus is when the birds begin chorusing at dawn. 
It is typically loud and between the hours of 5am and 7am. 
When you find it please box all of it, and label it with the number `1`, then hit _Next_.

On the next screen we will be **timing you** to see how quickly you can find specific sounds.

We would like you to find **one example** of each of the listed sounds as **quickly** as possible.

Your time **starts when you open the page** and **ends when you hit the _Continue_ button**.

Click Continue (under the visualisation) when you are ready to begin.
