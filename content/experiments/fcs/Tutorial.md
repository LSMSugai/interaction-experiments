Please click _Next_ - located above the soundscape.

If you drag your cursor over the soundscape (left click and hold) you will see a box appear. 

Next to the box is a field that you can use to enter a description of what you think the sound is. 

Try drawing a box anywhere on the soundscape and entering a description of what you think it is.

Before you progress to the next screen, delete any boxes you created by hovering over the box and clicking the x.
