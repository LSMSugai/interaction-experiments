We would like you to explore some long-duration environmental recordings, or **soundscapes**. You can see one in the space below.

Each soundscape contains 24 continuous hours (**a full day**) of audio, which may have been collected from suburban, rural or wilderness sites. 

Please click _Next_ - located above the soundscape.

---

Click the PLAY button on the audio bar.

Try **dragging the audio button** to that point in the soundscape to learn more about it.

When you are happy that you understand how to use the audio, click _Next_.


---

If you drag your cursor over the soundscape (**left click and hold**) you will see a box appear. 

Next to the box is a field that you can use to enter a description of what you think the sound is. 

Try drawing a box anywhere on the soundscape and entering a description of what you think it is.

Before you progress to the next screen, **delete all the boxes** you created by hovering over the box and clicking the x.

---

Take some time to explore some interesting points in the soundscape.

Box **five things** that you would **like to explore** more.

Please **label and save** the boxes. 

When you are done hit _Continue_ below the soundscape.
