We would like you to explore some long-duration environmental recordings, or **soundscapes**. You can see one in the space below.

Each soundscape contains 24 continuous hours (**a full day**) of audio, which have been collected from rural or wilderness sites. 

Please click _Next_---located above the soundscape.

---

Click the _Play_ <img src="play_button.png" class="ie-inline-image" /> button on the audio bar.

Try **clicking on the seek bar** at any point in the soundscape to learn more about it.

When you are happy that you understand how to use the audio, click _Next_.


---

If you drag your cursor over the soundscape (**left click and hold**) you will see a box appear. 

Next to the box is a field that you can use to make a **label** of what you think the sound is. 

To keep a box visible you need to **save your label**. Try it now and click _Next_ when you understand the function. 



---

To **delete any boxes** you saved, hover over the box and click the delete button <img src="/annotorious/css/delete.png" class="ie-inline-image" />. Try it now.

When you are happy that you understand how to box and label audio, hit _Continue_ below the soundscape.
