On the next screen we will present you with a **different soundscape**.

We will again be **timing you** to see how quickly you can find specific sounds. 

We would like you to find, box, and label **one example** of each of the sounds listed as **quickly** as possible.

When you are ready to begin click _Continue_ and the soundscape will appear and your timer will start.  

Click  _Continue_ again when you have completed the task to end the timer.
