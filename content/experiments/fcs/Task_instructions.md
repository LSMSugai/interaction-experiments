On the next screen we will present you with a different soundscape.

We will be **timing you** to see how quickly you can find these sounds when you don't have any prior knowledge of the soundscape. 

We would like you to find **one example** of each of the sounds listed as **quickly** as possible.

Your time **starts when you open the page** and **ends when you hit the 'Continue' button**.

When you are ready to begin click _Continue_ and the soundscape will appear.  
Click  _Continue_ again when you have completed the task to end the timer.
