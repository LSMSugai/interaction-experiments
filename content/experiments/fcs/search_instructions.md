We would like to time **how quickly** you can find examples of a given sound. 

You will be given **three different soundscapes in a row**, each with **three sounds** that we want you to find.  

Try to find **one example** of each sound.

Box the **entire sound** from beginning to end, being as accurate as you can. 

**Save** the corresponding label using the **drop down list** under the box. 





When you are ready to begin, click _Continue_ and your timer will start.
