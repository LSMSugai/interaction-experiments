We would like to time how quickly you can find examples of a given sound. 

You will be given three different soundscapes in a row, each with three different sounds that we want you to find.  

Try to find, box, and label **one example** of each sound, using the corresponding number. 

For example, if you see 'Bird call - 1', enter **1** as the label.

Please box the **entire sound** from beginning to end. 

And most importantly, remember to **save your labels!**

When you are ready to begin click _Continue_ and your timer will start.
