We will now give you **three different soundscapes** in a row.

This time we will be **timing you** to see how quickly you can find box, and label **one example** of each of the sounds listed as **quickly** as possible. Your timer will stop when you have completed each of the three screens.

Please enter the **corresponding number** to label each box, e.g. if 'bird call' is under **1**, enter **1** as the label.

Please box the **entire sound** from beginning to end. 

And most importantly, remember to **save your labels!**

When you are ready to begin click _Continue_ and your timer will start.
