# Tutorial



If you hover your cursor over the soundscape you will see it change to +. You can use this to draw a box anywhere on the soundscape to indicate what you think is interesting using the select tool. 

Try it now. Draw as many boxes as you like. 
They can be any size. They can overlap. You can also click and drag to move them. You can also delete them.

When you are happy that you understand how to use it, click Next.
