Why is the study being conducted? </b><p>
This research project is being undertaken by the QUT Ecoacoustics Group in order to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of using different visualisations of long-duration acoustic recordings of the environment. In particular it seeks to better understand how people use these visualisations to search and explore this kind of data.

You are invited to participate in this research project because you are aged 18 years or older and have an interest in ecology or the environment.<p>

**What does participation involve?** <p>
Participation will involve completing several tasks to the best of your ability and answering questions about your experience. It should take you between 30-40 minutes to complete.<p>

Example questions include:<p>

* Can you tell us what you learned from completing this task?<br>
* Can you tell us what characteristics of the visualization made you choose sounds of interest?<p>

Your participation in this research project is entirely voluntary. If you agree to participate you do not have to complete any questions you are uncomfortable answering. Your decision to participate or not participate will in no way impact upon your current or future relationship with QUT or the QUT Ecoacoustics Group. If you do agree to participate you can withdraw from the research project during your participation without comment or penalty. However as the survey does not request any personal identifying information, once it has been submitted it will not be possible to withdraw.

**What are the possible benefits for me if I take part?**<br>
It is expected that this research project will not directly benefit you. The outcomes of the research, however, may benefit ecologists as it will help us develop better ways of analyzing long-duration environmental recordings.<p>

To recognise your contribution should you choose to participate, the research team is offering you the chance to enter a prize draw to win an AU$100 Amazon gift card. Alternatively, if you win, you may choose to nominate an environmental conservation charity for us to donate AU$100 to.<p>

Please note the closing date for entries is 30 December, 2019.<p>
