On the next screen you will see the same soundscape you have been working with in the tutorial.

However, this time we will be **timing you** to see how quickly you can find specific sounds.

We would like you to find **one example** of each of the listed sounds as **quickly** as possible.

Please enter the **corresponding number** to label each box, e.g. if 'bird call' is **1**, enter **1** as the label.

Remember to **save your labels**!

Your time **starts when you open the page** and **ends when you hit the _Continue_ button**.

Click _Continue_ when you are ready to begin.
